        <p>Maipú is a commune located in the western area of Santiago, Chile, and one of the most populated in the
            country.
            It combines residential neighborhoods with a strong commercial and service activity. It stands out for the
            Votive Temple of Maipú, a historic site linked to independence, as well as its parks and recreational areas
            such as Tres
            Poniente Park. The commune also has cultural centers, large shopping malls, schools, universities, and a
            transport network
            that connects it to the rest of the capital.</p>
